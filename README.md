Solo project made in 48 hours for Pixl Jam 2014. Built using a very early version of Omicron.

A top-down shooter style game. Ships are made up out of blocks, destroy enemy ships to add their blocks to your ship.

Use arrows to move, and space to shoot.

The game doesn't have a win or conditions as I ran out of time.

Requirements:

SFML-2.1 (Window management, Access to OpenGL, Music, and Sound)
Glew (OpenGL extensions)
DevIL (Image loading)
Boost (time)
